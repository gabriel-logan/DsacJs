# Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of n is denoted by n! and is defined as:

n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ... * 1

The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

## Usage

```js
import { factorial } from "dsacjs";

console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
```
