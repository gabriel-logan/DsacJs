# Factorial

The factorial of a non-negative integer n is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of n is denoted by n! and is defined as:

n! = n _ (n-1) _ (n-2) _ ... _ 1

The factorial of 0 is defined to be 1.

## Usage

```js
import { factorial } from "dsacjs";

console.log(factorial(5)); // 120
```
